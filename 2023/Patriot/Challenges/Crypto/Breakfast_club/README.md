# Breakfast club

**Points** : 252

As the sysadmin for your college, you're responsible for overseeing the security of all the clubs. One of the on campus orginizations is a breakfast club with their own personal website that the leader assured you was "unhackable". He was so sure of this, that he sent you an example of how hashes are stored in the database, something about "changing the hash type multiple times for each password" or something like that. Can you crack the password and prove him wrong?
