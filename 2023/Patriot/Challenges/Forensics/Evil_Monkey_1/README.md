# Evil Monkey 1

**Category** : Forensics
**Points** : 451

One of the employees at our studio "Meatball Works" sent out this blend file to an external company for review and lighting reworks. When it came back, our EDR system captured malicious traffic that seemed to be coming from Blender. One of the SOC analysts found some sort of encrypted shellcode in the file but doesn't know the encryption key. Can you find it?
