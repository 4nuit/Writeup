# Read The EULA

**Category** : Forensics
**Points** : 484

My friend and I use to play Minecraft all the time together, but with recent updates he went off on some tangent about something called a Eula or something like that. Anyways, he said he found a new mining game he was testing but wouldn't tell me the name of it. All he sent was a PCAP of him playing the game, saying he hid a flag in his movement... whatever that means.
