Greetings analyst! As you know, our recent attempts to acquire a very lucrative contract failed when our customer decided to go with a *Swedish* competitor instead. Unfortunately, the SkyTractor-9000 and its munition the VFFR (Very Fast Flying Rock, accurate to within a ***1m^2 by 1m^2*** zone!) were very expensive to develop and build, and we only ended up building one SkyTractor-9000 . Thankfully, we have a plan to ...convince our customer to reconsider the contract and get more money to build more. This is where you come in.

We need you to find the location of the aircraft in the rightmost part of the photo (the one between 06 and 05). ***Don't give us latitude and longitude***, we need a form of geolocation more precise and reliable than that (that involves using 3 words) for our needs. Try to get your location right on the intersection between the yellow lines in the middle. Our pilot will handle the rest from there. Good luck!
