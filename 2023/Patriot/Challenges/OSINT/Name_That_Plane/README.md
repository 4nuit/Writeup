# Name That Plane

**Category** : OSINT
**Points** : 483

Time to identify some planes. I'd like you to identify the aircraft in the zoomed in picture and the airport it was photographed at.

The name of the plane should include its number ex:
If your plane is the Siebel Si 201:
Siebel_Si_201

An IATA code for an airport looks like this: Name: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport IATA Code: DCA
