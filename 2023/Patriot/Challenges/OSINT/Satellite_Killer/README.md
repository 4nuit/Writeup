# Satellite Killer

**Category** : OSINT
**Points** : 213

Most satellites get to live out a relatively peaceful existence in space until their orbit eventually decays and they fall back to Earth.

Most.

Back in the 80's, one poor satellite met a premature end at the hands of an ASM-135.

I would like you to find the date that the second-to-last piece of its debris fell back down to Earth (Or more realistically, its decay date).

In addition, please give me its object ID/International Code.

*Flag format: PCTF{OBJECTID_YEAR-MONTH-DAY} *

*For example, for a piece of debris from the Falcon 9, the flag would look like this: PCTF{2023-028BG_2023-3-15}*
