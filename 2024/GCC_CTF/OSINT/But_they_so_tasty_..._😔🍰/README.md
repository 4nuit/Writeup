# But they so tasty ... 😔🍰

Our OSINT teacher, sir Staffengaouehll, joined us in class dead tired.<br>
Apparently he started running 👀<br>
Problem is, he didn't stop his bad habit of savouring **2 coconut flan slices almost everydays!**

You alarmed him but he won't listen.
> "It's not **that** bad ???"

Show him why he should watchout by giving him the amount of kilo Jouls he gets everytimes he eats his 2 flan slices!

> Flag format is ``GCC{<kJ here>_m1ghT_b3_t0o_MucH}`` with the kilo Jouls rounded to the upper value. Exemple 456.7 kJ would give this flag ``GCC{457_m1ghT_b3_t0o_MucH}``
