# Warp_jump

**Category** : Reverse
**Points** : 453

A friend of yours simulated a Warp drive allowing faster-than-light travel, but the process if difficult and unpredictable.

To navigate you will have to overcome the limitation of warp travel and make best use of calculated jumps.

Do you have what it takes to navigate this treacherous path ?"
