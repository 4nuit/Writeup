You’ve just finished assembling your brand-new FPV drone using the parts Santa brought you:
    - a shiny new digital VTX for crisp HD video,
    - a GPS module to measure the distance from your takeoff point and ensure a proper failsafe.

Excited on the morning of December 25th, you launch your first flight **without taking the time to configure the failsafe**. Your FPV drone took off from a small field (coordinates: **`47.5988223,-1.1389015`**).

During your flight session, the magic of Christmas suddenly fades: the video feed cuts out abruptly...
Fortunately, your DJI FPV goggles automatically recorded the entire flight ; including **the very last frame** transmitted before the blackout.

 **Your mission:**
Analyze this final image and recover the approximate coordinates (**three decimal places**) of the location where your drone ended its journey.
Santa is counting on you to save this precious gift!

> **Expected flag format:** `RM{XX.XXX,YY.YYY}`
