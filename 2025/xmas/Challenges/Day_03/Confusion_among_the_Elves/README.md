Every winter, the elves’ factory relies on a massive statistics system to optimize gift production. Everything was running smoothly… until *DevSecOops* the elf spilled his eggnog all over his laptop. Disaster: **he lost the only access to the production server**, which contains the one and only copy of Santa’s List!

From his… let’s say “foggy” memory, the file should be somewhere inside the **/opt/ directory**.

Time is running out: without the list, there’s no way to finish production before the big day.

**Your mission? Find a way to recover the list by accessing the production server!**

Save Christmas… and DevSecOops’ already fragile reputation!
