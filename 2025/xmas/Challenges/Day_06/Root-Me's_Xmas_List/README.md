Root-Me's volunteers have prepared their wish lists to Father Christmas, nevertheless it seems that some lists with, specific requests, are only accessible to Father Christmas himself. However, a jealous elf, unhappy about not being able to prepare all the gifts has decided to try to get access no matter what. Unfortunately he did not succeed, which is why he's requesting for your help.

The only thing the elf managed is to get a network capture of when Father Christmas logged onto the app where the lists are stored.

Now it's your turn to help the elf and find a way to access the restricted lists, they might even hide something you're looking for.
