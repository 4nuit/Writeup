Oh no, it looks like the Grinch’s assistant pwned us !
Luckily, our experts managed to recover two key informations:
- A **file hash**: `bf6a54d181b9bbcb168720b9d466ca27d14ead283220ee5a9e777352c16edca3`
- A leaked message that said more intels can be found **somewhere in a vault**.

Our team keeps digging but we wouldn’t mind a bit of help..
Will you please help us finding intel on them ?
