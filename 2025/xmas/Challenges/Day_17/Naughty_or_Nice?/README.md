This year, Santa decided to automate the Naughty-or-Nice list using a machine-learning model. To respect privacy regulations, he doesn’t store personal data: instead, each child is represented by a small, meaningless 32×32 grayscale image. To humans, these pictures look like random noise. To Santa’s model, they are everything.

Before deploying the system, Santa asks you to test it using one image, "base.png", currently classified as Nice. While experimenting with the API, you discover something worrying: the model’s decision can be flipped.

If you can make the model classify this image as Naughty without being detected… then maybe every child ends up on the naughty list — and all the presents are yours.
