Your life at work is falling apart
Your colleagues gave you socks for Secret Santa... used ones
Your manager only talks to you to forward bugs... and blame you for them
And as a final holiday gift, you've been assigned to maintain "VM Checker", a duct-taped bash script that even interns refuse to touch

*But it technically works*

This Christmas, you've had enough!
Become root. Wreak havoc. And finally earn the respect you've been denied all year
Or at least, find the flag...

**Connection informations:**
- *type*: ssh
- *ssh username*: `user`
- *ssh password*: `user`
-  *challenge directory*: `/home/user/vmchecker/`

> `ssh user@dyn-XX.xmas.root-me.org -p <XXXX>`
