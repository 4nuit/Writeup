Our reconnaissance team has successfully infiltrated the **North Pole Industries intranet**. After weeks of surveillance, we have obtained valid credentials to their employee portal. The access password is "**northpole2025**".

Intelligence suggests that Santa Claus maintains a **private communication service** used to exchange sensitive operational data, including his personal notes. This system, known internally as the "Santa Claus Communication Service" (SCCS), is scheduled to be introduced in an upcoming training workshop. The employee portal may contain technical documentation or implementation details that could help you understand how the system works.

We have identified the deployed SCCS server, access details are provided below. Your objective is to break into the Santa Claus Communication Service and exfiltrate **Santa's Private Notes** for us. Good luck, agent.
